1: How much time did you spend on the hw?
    I think I spent like 12 hrs on this hw? 
    I forgot to keep track so this is just a rough estimate.
2: What did you learn from this hw?
    This was a nice refresher on inheritance, 
    and also helped me understand how to implement 
    two different csv files into the same place array.
3: What did you struggle with during this homework?
    I literally can't figure out how to get Driver2 correct. 
    The only thing wrong was a [0] instead of a [] and no matter what I do I can't get it to go away.
    I'm assuming it has something to do with the population? 
    But even when I don't create the population if there isn't one to access I still fail it. 
    Its kind of driving me insane so I'm just being happy with an 87%...
